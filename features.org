The given SQL scripts create various features derived from historical transactions for customers. Here is a detailed description of each feature based on the database schema and operations:

1. *Feature 1_122*: This feature calculates the minimum days between the customer's transaction dates and the reference date for each record in the =POPULATION_TRAIN__STAGING_TABLE_1=. It focuses on determining the shortest duration since a customer's historical transaction to the reference date.

2. *Feature 1_115*: This feature counts the distinct transaction dates for each customer up to the reference date. It reflects the number of unique days a customer has made transactions.

3. *Feature 1_126*: This feature computes the median of the days between transaction dates and the reference date. The median provides a middle point of transaction activities regarding their temporal proximity to the reference date.

4. *Feature 1_124*: This feature identifies the mode of days between historical transactions and the reference date for each customer. It indicates the most frequently occurring time gap in days between transactions and the reference point.

5. *Feature 1_125*: This feature finds the first occurrence of the days difference between transactions and the reference date, chronologically, for each customer. It tracks the earliest time difference observed in the transaction history leading up to the reference date.

These features integrate customer transaction data with temporal metrics, utilizing information about customer demographics and transaction behaviors to potentially enhance models for customer analysis. Specifically, they leverage connections between historical purchase behavior and relevant temporal metrics to produce meaningful insights about customer engagement and activity patterns.

* Do those features make sense to you?

Yes, these features seem logical and could provide valuable insights when analyzing customer behavior:

1. *Feature 1_122*: By calculating the minimum days since the last transaction, you can assess how recently a customer has been engaged, which might correlate with their current interest or likelihood to purchase again.

2. *Feature 1_115*: Counting distinct transaction days gives an indication of customer activity frequency, helping to segment customers based on how often they engage with the brand.

3. *Feature 1_126*: The median days between transactions can provide a stable measure of transaction regularity, useful for identifying typical engagement intervals.

4. *Feature 1_124*: The mode of the transaction gaps might highlight a recurring pattern in purchasing habits, potentially useful for timing marketing actions.

5. *Feature 1_125*: Finding the earliest time difference gives insight into how quickly the customer engages after a reference point, which might relate to responses to promotions or product launches.

Overall, these features are designed to capture different aspects of customer transaction behavior over time, which is crucial for predictive modeling, personalization strategies, or customer segmentation.
