    "# Predicting Item Sales with getML on H&M Fashion Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use [getML](https://getml.com) to predict item sales on the H&M Fashion dataset,\n",
    "outperforming other approaches in the [Relational Deep Learning Benchmark (RelBench)](http://relbench.stanford.edu/). We achieve this with minimal code complexity and without requiring knowledge from the business domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Focus on Feature Engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pedro Domingos, a leading ML researcher, highlighted in his famous 2012 paper that *features are the most critical factor in machine learning.*\n",
    "Features are the \"language\" that allows prediction models to interpret relational data. If that language is poor or incomplete, even the best-tuned models will underperform. In classical ML approaches like gradient boosting features are undoubtly king. At getML, our mission is to automate feature engineering for relational data, minimizing the need for complex models, manual SQL code, and business domain expertise – often the Achilles' heel of predictive analytics. The importance of features isn’t limited to gradient boosting. Even in deep learning (text and images), architectures like CNNs, RNNs, and transformers see 70-90% of all operations count toward feature extraction. Regardless of the model, it’s the quality of features – not just the final layers – that drives performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why getML?\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational learning is heavily underutilized across industries. At getML, we aim to change that by advancing the field through innovative feature learning algorithms. [FastProp](https://getml.com/latest/user_guide/concepts/feature_engineering/#feature-engineering-algorithms-fastprop) (Fast Propositionalization) is one of our core algorithms, automating feature engineering for regression and classification tasks on relational data. It runs *[60 to 1000 times faster](https://github.com/getml/getml-community?tab=readme-ov-file#benchmarks)* than tools like [featuretools](https://www.featuretools.com) and [tsfresh](https://tsfresh.com), while scaling effortlessly to millions of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First Time Using getML?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're new to getML, consider starting with the simpler [notebook on user churn](hm-churn.ipynb) for an introduction to basic concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Notebook Covers\n",
    "\n",
    "While getML can serve as a complete end-to-end solution, getML is also designed for seamless integration with other frameworks. In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "- Use getML for *feature engineering* only and export (`transform`) the generated features, to\n",
    "- train a *LightGBM regressor* on these features for prediction, and\n",
    "- tune the resulting model with *Optuna* for hyperparameter optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is divided into six key sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Setup](#1.-Setup) – Launch the getML engine and download the H&M dataset from RelBench.\n",
    "2. [Data Preparation](#2.-Data-Preparation) – Load the dataset, define roles, and create a DataModel.\n",
    "3. [The Basline Model](#3.-The-Baseline-Model) – Train a simple pipeline with FastProp and XGBoostRegressor.\n",
    "4. [The Refined Model](#4.-The-Refined-Model) – Explore FastProp’s parameters and optimize the DataModel.\n",
    "5. [Exporting Features](#5.-Exporting-Features) – Generate features and export them for external use.\n",
    "6. [Training LightGBM](#6.-Training-LightGBM) – Train and evaluate a LightGBM regressor using Optuna for tuning."

In the face of brute force methods (like FastProp), this can lead to an explosion in features as we are creating a new feature for each level of the categorical column for each aggregation we aplly to a column for each column we aggregate over. I.e. the total number of features grows exponentially with the number of categories in the categorical column.\n",

FastProp will only create features for the `n_most_frequent` categories in a column, all other categories will be binned into a single category. This is especially useful when dealing with columns that contain many categories (like `sales_channel_id`). If we set `n_most_frequent=2`,\n",
